# Half Man Half Biscuit Lyric Randomiser

Lyrics are fetched using the [Half man Half Biscuit lyrics project](https://halfmanhalfbiscuit.uk/),
specifically their randomiser script at <https://halfmanhalfbiscuit.uk/rantex.php>

## Why would you even bother?

Yes exactly, there is probably no reason for you to ever use this library,
unless you just need HMHB lyrics on hand with a moments notice,
like a weird post punk junkie.

This was just to help me learn some basic lua, and understand bash / buffers better.
